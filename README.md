This is one of my last year projects in Sakarya University written in C#.
We used visualStudio 2022 and the forms to create a basic cash register application. We used windows forms and also DBfirst approach while making this application.

let me show you what it can do:

When you open the application the first screen you will see will be the main screen below:

after adding the products you can register the pay amount from the customer and then you can press on the "ödenen" to see the change you need to give to the customer:

if you click on one of the empty spots in Hızlı Buton you will see a page that opens up to add a product into it:
