This is one of my last year projects in Sakarya University written in C#.
We used visualStudio 2022 and the forms to create a basic cash register application. We used windows forms and also DBfirst approach while making this application.

let me show you what it can do:

When you open the application the first screen you will see will be the main screen below:

When you enter the satış işlemi you will see a basic screen that allows the basic funtionalities of a cash registers like entering barcod to register products see the total price ext:

These butons here work as a normal cash register. After you enter the number you press on either Barcod, adet or ödenen to spesify what that number means:

You can register products by entering their barkod or just by clicking one of the options in hızlı işlem part at right top corner:

after adding the products you can register the pay amount from the customer and then you can press on the "ödenen" to see the change you need to give to the customer:

if you click on one of the empty spots in Hızlı Buton you will see a page that opens up to add a product into it:

With Diğer Ürün buton you can add a product that does not have barcod.
With İade you can make a register the return of the product
With Temizle you can just clean all the registered items and begin again
